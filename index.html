                    <p>To me, modern calligraphy became the way I express my feelings. Writing things down in such a beauty and elegant way makes me feel like I can make time stop and relive past moments or emotions. To me, it is like a superpower.</p>

                    <div class="box2">The discovery</div>
                    <p>It all started with a gift I received from a friend. It was a calligraphy set composed of a quill pen and an inkwell. At first all I was capable of doing was stain everything around me, but with time, I practiced and learned how to handle them.</p>

                    <p>&quot;Ultimately, what gets written is not words, but feeling, or what is written into the words is feeling. The hand writes the heart.&quot; - Steven Skaggs</p>
